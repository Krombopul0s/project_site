                <p>Below is code I wrote for a movie recoomendation site as the final project in the Javascript specialization. I'm starting to see a trend in learning to code with the movie recommendation projects. The code provides for generation of the movies via a short survey of movie interests.
                    The actual framework of the site itself is provided by Duke, the students provided the code for the generator.

        <h3>Photo Filter</h3>
            <p id="author"> by Tim LaRoy </p>
            <p>This is one of the first projects I did. I learned a lot about writing code that not only works, but works relatively quickly.</p>
            <p>That being said, I still have a lot to learn about streamlining code for smoother operation and writing less redundant code.</p>
            <p>There was also an implementaiton of a rainbow filter which I've left out in order to spare crashing your browser. It works if you want to
                try it, but you have been warned. You can still see the rainbow filter code below if you click on the code block. all you need to do is 
                uncomment the button for the filter.
                This was the first real project I had after "Hello World" and I like to leave it unchanged because even with its flaws, I'm proud of it.
