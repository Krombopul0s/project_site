            <p>This is one of the first projects I did. I learned a lot about writing code that not only works, but works quickly.</p>
            <p>That being said, I still have a lot to learn about streamlining code for smoother operation and writing less redundant code.</p>
            <p>P.S. try the rainbow filter at your own risk. It works, but slowly.</p>
